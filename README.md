# TrustElect-A-Web-Based-Voting-System-with-Content-Management

## Project Description

The proposed system aims to develop and implement a secure web-based voting
platform for STI College Novaliches that upholds electoral integrity. This digital solution
seeks to address the limitations of traditional paper-based voting by providing a reliable
online voting mechanism with robust security protocols to prevent unauthorized access and
vote tampering. 

The system will incorporate transparency measures through partial vote
verification and comprehensive audit logs, enabling administrators to monitor participation
while preserving voter anonymity until official results are tabulated.
Security forms the foundation of this voting system through the implementation of
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and End-to-end Encryption (E2EE).
